# QSAR Web App

This project is a comprehensive web application for performing Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) analysis using Streamlit. The application allows users to fetch bioactivity data from a ChEMBL database, compute molecular fingerprints, and train machine learning models for regression and classification tasks. It supports SMILES input files and outputs predictions based on trained models.

## Features

- Fetch bioactivity data from ChEMBL using ChEMBL IDs.
- Compute molecular fingerprints using RDKit and PaDEL-Descriptor.
- Train and save the best regression and classification models.
- Process SMILES files to predict bioactivity classes and pIC50 values.
- Provide downloadable results as CSV files.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/QSAR_Web_App.git
    cd QSAR_Web_App
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Ensure you have the ChEMBL database (`chembl_34.db`) in the specified directory.

4. Run the Streamlit application:
    ```sh
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

## Usage

### Fetching Bioactivity Data

1. Enter the ChEMBL ID of the target.
2. Click "Fetch Data" to retrieve bioactivity data for the specified target.
3. The data will be displayed in the app and saved as CSV and SMI files.

### Computing Molecular Fingerprints

1. Ensure the SMI file is saved in the specified directory.
2. Click "Compute Fingerprints" to generate PaDEL and RDKit fingerprints.
3. The computed fingerprints will be saved as CSV files.

### Training Models

1. Train the best regression model:
    - Click "Train Regression Model".
    - The best model will be trained and saved based on R² score.
2. Train the best classification model:
    - Click "Train Classification Model".
    - The best model will be trained and saved based on accuracy.

### Processing New SMILES Files

1. Upload a SMILES file in CSV or SMI format.
2. Click "Process SMILES File".
3. The app will compute fingerprints, apply trained models, and output predictions.
